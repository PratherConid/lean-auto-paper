\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented the ITP to ATP translation implemented in Lean-auto.
Our contributions are three-fold. First, we addressed challenges posed by
Lean4's dependent type theory and its various language features. Second, we formally
presented our monomorphization algorithm in the context of dependent type theory.
Finally, we implemented the translation procedure in Lean-auto and applied it to Mathlib4.

A possible direction for future work is to design a \textit{complete} $\lambda_\to^*$
abstraction algorithm. By \textit{complete}, we mean that for any essentially
higher-order $\lambda C$ problem $p$, the algorithm should always find a provable
higher-order problem $\varphi$ and a ``substitution'' $\sigma$ such that $p$
is the image of $\varphi$ under $\sigma$. Another direction is to investigate
potential ways of handling existential type quantifiers and non-leading universal
type quantifiers.
