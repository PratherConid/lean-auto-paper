  Proof automation is crucial to large-scale formal mathematics and software/hardware verification projects
  in ITPs. Sophisticated tools called \textit{hammers} have been developed to provide general proof
  automation in ITPs such as Coq and Isabelle, leveraging the power of ATPs. An important
  component of a hammer is the translation algorithm from the ITP's logical system
  to the ATP's logical system. In this paper, we propose a novel translation algorithm
  for ITPs based on dependent type theory. The algorithm is implemented in Lean4 under
  the name Lean-auto. The core of our algorithm is inspired by the monomorphization
  procedure in Isabelle Sledgehammer, but, as we explain, handling Lean4's dependent types
  and its various language features requires substantially new ideas.
  Soundness of the translation procedure is guaranteed, and experimental results suggest that
  our algorithm is sufficiently complete for practical uses of Lean4 in formal mathematics and
  software verification. We also show that our algorithm produces more efficient
  translations compared to the encoding-based approach used in CoqHammer.
