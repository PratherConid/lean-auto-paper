\section{Experiments}\label{sectexpr}

  We evaluate Lean-auto on three types of ATPs:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Native provers, or ATPs implemented in Lean4 itself. Currently, the only general-purpose
      native prover in Lean4 is Duper \cite{DuperPaper}. Note that Lean-auto is
      used as a preprocessing step in Duper (cf. sect. 5 of \cite{DuperPaper}).
      This is because Duper's core algorithm, which is based on the algorithm used
      in the higher-order prover Zipperposition \cite{ZipperpositionMakeWork}, has limited support for dependent
      type theory, and has difficulty handling Lean4 features like typeclasses.
    \item TPTP solvers. We chose Zipperposition because it supports HOL.
    \item SMT solvers. For this category, we chose Z3 and CVC5. Since SMT solvers
      still don't fully support HOL, we implemented a simple procedure
      (which is incomplete but sufficiently sound) to translate the HOL output of Lean-auto into FOL.
  \end{enumerate}

  Currently, Lean-auto only supports proof reconstruction for native provers,
  which utilizes a verified checker implemented in Lean-auto. An
  ongoing project Lean-smt\footnote{GitHub link: https://github.com/ufmg-smite/lean-smt}
  will provide support for SMT proof reconstruction in the future. For TPTP solvers,
  the verified checker in Lean-auto may be extended to support their proof reconstruction.
  % TODO: TPTP solvers can also be used as premise selection for duper, similar to Sledgehammer
